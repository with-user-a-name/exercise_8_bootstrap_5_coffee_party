# Exercise 8: Bootstrap 5 - Coffee Party

 A First Prototype for a Company Website

You have been tasked by an innovative young company whose core process is to deliver coffee and coffee machines to other businesses. They also organize a very popular coffee party event that both individuals and companies can order. At the coffee party, a variety of coffee types are presented for tasting, along with dark chocolate, and attendees have the opportunity to purchase the products.

You will create a website with three pages: “Index,” “Products,” and “About Us.”

## For all pages (3 total):

- An appropriate and consistent color theme
- Header; with logo or company name (or both)
- Navbar; with links to all pages
- Footer; with copyright date and webmaster information

## Index:

- Divided into four main sections:
  - Who are we?
  - What do we do?
  - Why choose us?
  - Coffee party, how it works!
- Each section should contain placeholder text (https://www.lipsum.com/) and placeholder images. A quick Google search provides good images for a prototype, but if you're short on time or looking for very specific sizes, https://picsum.photos/ is a handy tip.

## Products:

- Separate Coffee Parties and Coffee Machines.
- List coffee machines, different models with descriptions and images.
- The layout should be divided into two parts:
  - Coffee Machines:
    - Lists coffee machines in a grid format
    - Information, model, and price should be clearly visible
  - Coffee Party:
    - Divided into two parts: Businesses and Individuals

## About Us/Contact:

- Contains more information about the company.
- Contact details with image, phone number, name, and email for the CEO.
- Contact details with image, phone number, name, and email for the HR manager.

The site should function equally well on mobile devices as on a regular computer. This exercise is intentionally left quite open and is intended as an opportunity to experiment a bit and test different aspects of Bootstrap.

Good luck!
